# Android MotionLayout Multi-state Demo

In this example, MotionLayout is used to move an image from off-screen to on-screen when the screen is tapped. This motion toggles, so another tap will move the image back off-screen.

This demo was inspired by a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g1z01e/motionlayout_constraining_off_the_screen/), and partialy based on the [Android MotionLayout multi-state example project](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/motionlayout/examples#multi-state).
